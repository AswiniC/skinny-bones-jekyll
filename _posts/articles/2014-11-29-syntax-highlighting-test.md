We deliver vermicompost fertilizer to increase the soil fertility and for increased productivity of plants.
We use different compost to meet specific need:

* Cow Dung
* Goat Dung
* Vegetable Waste
* Cocopeat

Vermicomposting is the creation of nutritious compost using worms. It’s easy (the worms do most of the work) and extremely good for your plants. The resulting compost is often called worm castings and it’s what the worms have cast off as they eat the scraps you feed them. It is, essentially, worm poop, but it’s loaded with nutrients your plants need.
